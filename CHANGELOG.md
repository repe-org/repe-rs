# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-05
- Added multi-node fleet APIs:
  - `Fleet` for synchronous TCP request/response fanout
  - `AsyncFleet` for asynchronous tokio-based TCP fanout
  - `UniUdpFleet` for unidirectional UDP fanout
- Added shared fleet types and configuration:
  - `NodeConfig`, `FleetOptions`, `RetryPolicy`
  - `RemoteResult`, `HealthStatus`
  - connect/disconnect/reconnect summary types
- Added fleet operations:
  - connection lifecycle (`connect_all`, `disconnect_all`, `reconnect_disconnected`)
  - single-node calls (`call_json`, `call_message`)
  - tag-filtered broadcast (`broadcast_json`) and reduction (`map_reduce_json`)
  - per-node health checks (`health_check`)
- Updated TCP fleet retry policy to retry only transport/I/O failures and stop retrying on application-level server errors.
- Added UDP foundations:
  - `UniUdpClient` with notify/request send APIs and per-message IDs, backed by the `uniudp` crate
  - UDP node config with redundancy/chunk/FEC fields
  - UniUDP default RS profile now uses `fec_group_size=4` with `parity_shards=2`
- Made UniUDP support opt-in behind the `fleet-udp` Cargo feature so TCP-only builds avoid UniUDP dependencies.
- Added integration tests for:
  - sync fleet behavior (`tests/fleet_tests.rs`)
  - async fleet behavior (`tests/async_fleet_tests.rs`)
  - UDP fleet behavior (`tests/uniudp_fleet_tests.rs`)
- Added fleet documentation (`docs/fleet.md`) and README examples.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-22
- Added multiplexed request handling to `Client` and `AsyncClient` so multiple in-flight calls can share a single connection and still match responses by request ID.
- Added per-request timeout helpers on both clients:
  - `call_json_with_timeout`
  - `call_typed_json_with_timeout`
  - `call_typed_beve_with_timeout`
- Added JSON batch helpers on both clients:
  - `batch_json`
  - `batch_json_with_timeout`
- Hardened unknown-response-ID handling:
  - unknown response IDs are now logged and dropped by default
  - late responses for timed-out requests are also dropped without tearing down the connection
- Made `AsyncClient` request tracking cancellation-safe so dropped call futures do not leak entries in the pending-request map.
- Preserved structured fatal response-loop errors when failing pending requests instead of flattening everything to `Io(ConnectionAborted)`.
- Bounded sync `Client::batch_json` worker threads to avoid unbounded OS thread creation on large batches.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-24
- Router middleware hooks (`with_middleware` / `register_middleware`) let servers centralize auth, logging, or validation without manually wrapping each handler.
- Router shared-struct registration now accepts any `Lockable` lock, including `tokio::sync`
  mutexes/RwLocks out of the box and `parking_lot` locks when the optional feature is enabled.
- Bumped the edition to Rust 2024 and raised the MSRV to 1.85.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-18
- Added full BEVE body support (builder helpers, response serialization, and message decoding) backed by the official `beve` crate.
- Server routers and typed handlers now accept BEVE payloads, mirroring existing JSON ergonomics.
- Documented BEVE usage and updated the spec reference URL; expanded tests to cover complex BEVE round-trips.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-09-17
- Added zero-copy query routing so servers reuse borrowed UTF-8 query slices, cutting per-request allocations and tightening error handling for invalid query encodings.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-09-17
- Stream sync and async REPE message I/O directly into final buffers to avoid extra allocations and copies.
- Reuse persistent buffered readers/writers in the TCP client to eliminate per-request socket clones.
